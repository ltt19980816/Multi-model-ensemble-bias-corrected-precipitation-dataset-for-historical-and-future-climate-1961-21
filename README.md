# Multi-model ensemble bias-corrected precipitation dataset for historical and future climate (1961–2099) in China
High precision precipitation products are the basis of precipitation-related research. Based on 27 global climate models (GCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), we designed eight schemes for comprehensively using the empirical quantile mapping (EQM) method and data ensemble method to conduct precipitation bias correction; then, we selected the scheme with the highest accuracy as the final bias correction scheme. Using the selected bias correction scheme, we created a monthly precipitation dataset with a 1° spatial resolution, which spans the historical period of 1961–2014 and the future period of 2015–2099 under three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios: SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585.
